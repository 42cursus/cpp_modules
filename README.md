The goal of these modules is to introduce one to Object-Oriented Programming.

This will be the starting point of ones C++ journey. \
Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. \
We decided to choose C++ since itâ€™s derived from your old friend C.

Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, \
your code will comply with the C++98 standard.
